# TicTacToe
Welcome to my Tic Tac Toe game. This was created as part of The Odin Project course I am working through.

My initial objective was to create a two player game that tracks score and allows the players to switch marks and choose to play again. I ended up also creating an option for a one player game against a computer player.

Through this project I learned a lot more about manipulating DOM elements, and creating modules and factories. I also learned A LOT about scope.
